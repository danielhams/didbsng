## Licensing

It is intended that any fedora `.spec` files listed here are under the "Fedora Project Contributor Agreement": https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legal:Fedora_Project_Contributor_Agreement.

Notably - fedora specifically mentions spec file licensing here: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#License_of_Fedora_SPEC_Files

Unless otherwise stated, those `.spec` files remain under their original license as per their contribution to Fedora. This project does not attempt to supplant nor change the license of these works.

The modifications from the original fedora `.spec` files fall under the license of the didbsng project, namely GPL3.
